# Clinic-Worstation-Logging-Automation r. togn 2017/18
[ALL NAMES REMOVED] Some automation for a clinic that, at the time, had no digital interface for patient logs...

This program was made to assist with logging patients, tests and billing information at an clinic's draw station. At the time there was no
cohesive digital management system or LIMS for employees to work with.

User enters patient information, selects tests ordered and the system will print out requisitions based on the given (arbitrary for all purporses) rules. It will then
take that info and print out labels for the appropriate number of tubes and papers as needed.

This info is logged into spreasheets that are saved and updated by date. Lists like tests, physicians and labs can be updated by a tech
with their respective CSV files in the Tests_Lists folder.

Much of this program is likely broken as I had to remove any references to people, companies logos etc.
